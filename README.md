For this project, I used Bootstrap to create an e-mail app template. The template has three breakpoints in the three columns implemented in this project (grid). 
This e-mail template must work properly on mobile devices (phones), tablets, and desktops. Also, additional styling for the template was performed using CSS.

Requirements:

[x] Code is readable
[x] Use of Bootstrap
